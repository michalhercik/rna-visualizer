<p>This is demonstration of a Typescript library for visualizing
multiple RNA secondary structures using template-based generation of
radial diagram for comparing structures between each other by mapping
diagrams via template diagram.</p>

<h2 id="canvas">Canvas</h2>
<p>Canvas is displaying structures as a radial diagrams. You can zoom or
pan canvas as you wish and in some <a
href="#navigation-panel">situations</a> by clicking on a nucleotide of a
template structure or near it on the <a href="#canvas">canvas</a> all
structures that has nucleotide that is mapped to the template nucleotide
are aligned to that nucleotide.</p>
<h2 id="control-panel">Control panel</h2>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Switch between sets of a structures.</li>
<li>turn on/off hover label which is displayed when you hover with mouse
over a nucleotide on the <a href="#canvas">canvas</a>.</li>
<li>Hide labels showing index of a nucleotide.</li>
<li>Reset position of structures to origin (left upper corner).</li>
<li>Change alpha for the <a href="#canvas">canvas</a>.</li>
<li>Set alpha for the <a href="#canvas">canvas</a> to default value,
which is proportional to number of displayed structures.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="alignment-groups">Alignment groups</h3>
<p>In alignment groups segment you can align structures by clicking on
one of the buttons. Each button has number that represents potential
number of aligned nucleotides so button with bigger number could align
more nucleotides than button with smaller number but it’s not a
rule.</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<h3 id="transformation">Transformation</h3>
<p>Transformation segment can be used for animated transformation of
structures to and from template structure. It is divided into two parts.
First part is hiding nucleotides which are not mapped to any template
nucleotide. Second part is moving all other nucleotides to the position
of their template nucleotides. 1. Duration of the animations second part
in miliseconds 2. Delay between hiding each nucleotide in the animations
first part. 3. Starts animated transformation.</p>

<h3 id="structures">Structures</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Shows/hides structure.</li>
<li>If checked, the structure won’t be transformed when clicking on <a
href="#transformation">transform</a> button.</li>
<li>Shows/hides mapping lines, which connects structure nucleotides with
nucleotides in template structure to which they are mapped.</li>
</ol>

</p>
<h2 id="navigation-panel">Navigation panel</h2>
<p>Changes content of <a href="#control-panel">control panel</a>.
Navigation panel has four options - Alignment, Layers, Transformation
and Combination. Alignment, Layers and Transformation isolates some
methods for visualizing and comparing RNA secondary structures. The
fourth option, Combination, is for working with all methods at once to
explore the full potentional of the library.</p>
<p>On the control panel you can always find <a href="#general">general
segment</a> where you for example switch between set of structures.
Besides general segment control panel always contains switch to turn
on/off mapping lines for each structure at <a
href="#structures">structures segment</a>.</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Alignment option is focusing on a alignment of structure diagrams. On
the control panel is available <a href="#alignment-groups">alignment
groups segment</a> where you can choose to which group of nucleotides
will be the structures aligned. You can also align on a specific
nucleotide by clicking on a <a href="#canvas">canvas</a>.</p>
<h3 id="layers">Layers</h3>
<p>For this option is additionaly available in <a
href="#structures">structures segment</a> checkboxes for showing/hiding
specific structures in a given set of structures.</p>
<h3 id="transformation-1">Transformation</h3>
<p>Transformation option gives you <a
href="#transformation">transformation segment</a> which is used for
animated transformation of structures to template structure. You can
also turn on/off transformation for specific structures in <a
href="#structures">structure segment</a></p>
